# Game Demo for Recreation of 5-minute Dungeon
This is a game demo for mechanics in our recreation of 5-minute Dungeon, and game where players work cooperatively to take on monsters in a board game. This project was created as part of the Spring 2022 Forge Cohort as part of Northeastern's Sherman Center. In addition to this virtual recreation, we also started work on a method for individuals with reduced vision to be able to play this typically visually focused game.

## How we built it
The code for the virtual creation was written in C++ to prepare for future integration with an Arduino.
